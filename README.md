# Pushback
**Pushback** is a draughts-style board game I invented, and this is the virtual version, being remade in Godot game engine.<br>
This is a turn-based game, and each player on their turn may move a tile of their color one square in any cardinal direction.<br>
A tile moving into a square occupied by another tile can **push** that tile if it has the strength required to do so.

The aim of the game is to push six tiles, whether your own or your opponent's, into your opponent's end area.
